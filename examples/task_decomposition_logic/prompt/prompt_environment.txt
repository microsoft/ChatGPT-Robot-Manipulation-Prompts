Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
{"environment":{"assets":["<table>", "<shelf_bottom>", "<shelf_top>", "<trash_bin>", "<floor>"],
    "asset_states": {"<shelf_bottom>": "on_something(<table>)", 
                    "<trash_bin>": "on_something(<floor>)"},
    "objects": ["<spam>", "<juice>"],
    "object_states": {"<spam>": "on_something(<table>)", 
                "<juice>": "on_something(<shelf_bottom>)"}}}
"""
Asset states and object states are represented using those state sets:
"""
"STATE LIST"
on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
inside_something(<something>): Object is located inside <something>
inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
closed(): Object can be opened
open(): Object can be closed or opened
"""
<something> should be one of the assets or objects in the environment.
